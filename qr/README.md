## Description

Brief Description of the QR Campaign Platform
Introduction
The QR Campaign Platform is an innovative solution designed to enhance user engagement and reward participation through a series of gamified campaigns. Built on the Telegram ecosystem and leveraging the TON blockchain, the platform enables shops to create and manage campaigns that encourage users to complete various achievements in exchange for tokens and rewards. This white paper outlines the key features, functionalities, and benefits of the platform.

Overview
The platform offers a seamless integration with Telegram, utilizing it as both a launcher for mini-apps and an authenticator for users. The core functionality revolves around shops creating campaigns that consist of multiple achievements. Users participate in these campaigns by completing tasks such as following social media accounts, connecting web3 wallets, staking tokens, or scanning QR codes at specified locations. Successful completion of achievements results in token rewards, which can be redeemed for products or additional benefits.

Key Components
Shops and Campaigns:

Shops: Entities that create and manage campaigns. Each shop has a unique profile and can set up multiple campaigns.
Campaigns: Defined by shops, campaigns consist of various achievements and offer rewards for completion. Campaigns have a start and end date, rules, and specific rewards.
Achievements:

Types of Achievements: Include social media actions (following on Twitter/Instagram), web3 actions (connecting wallets, staking tokens), and physical actions (scanning QR codes).
Verification: Actions are verified using APIs for social media, blockchain interactions for web3 tasks, and geolocation data for QR code scans.
Rewards and Tokens:

Token Issuance: Users earn tokens for completing achievements. These tokens are based on the TON blockchain and are managed through smart contracts.
Rewards: Tokens can be redeemed for products or additional benefits offered by shops. Rewards are limited to top performers or early achievers in some cases.
Smart Contracts:

Token Management: Handle the issuance and distribution of tokens securely and transparently.
Achievement Validation: Automate the validation of completed achievements and the distribution of rewards.
